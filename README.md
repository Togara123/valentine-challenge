The Valentine Challenge 

Welcome to the "Catch My Heart" digital experience! This is a custom-coded mini-game designed specifically for a very special person.

How to Play
1. The Mission: Click (or tap) the falling hearts to collect them.
2. The Goal: You need to catch 10 hearts before the 10-second timer runs out.
3. The Reward: Successfully catching enough hearts will unlock a secret question!

Tech Stack
HTML5/CSS3: For the "Glassmorphism" UI and responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles the falling physics, collision detection, and game logic.
Web Audio API: Generates real-time sound effects (no external audio files needed!).
Canvas-Confetti: For the final victory celebration.

Personal Note
I built this to show that my heart is yours if you're fast enough to catch it!
